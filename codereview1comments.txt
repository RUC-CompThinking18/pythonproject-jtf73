I see what you're driving at here, and I think you have a good conception of the kinds of things you can do with this data. I think the conversation now needs to be on execution and documentation. Recall that the assignment asks for a full introductory comment on the function you choose to write that explains not just what it does and why and where it fits into the larger scheme of your project. Remember that this project (and especially this first code review) isn't just about writing code but about documenting that code and the thinking behind it. You have some comments, but they don't get me as much of the "why" that I need to help you proceed. I also see you taking JSON input without parsing or otherwise manipulating it. Let's talk in person about the format of that data and how to access it.

Stray comments
Make your function names descriptive. Don't just name them after things you're interested in.
