This code is much more robust than the previous review, and I think you're doing well to jettison the API calls and just going with the local data. Definitely take some time to think about where you want to pull that data from. You also have one very descriptive comment down toward the bottom, which is great. The code itself didn't run, which loses you some points. I'm also still struggling to see the big picture, the "why" of this project: what is it saying about the world or about you?
